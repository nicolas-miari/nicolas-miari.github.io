### Spotlighter for iOS

Spotlighter is a small photo-editing app for iOS that lets you highlight a custom region 
within an image by applying a spotlight-like effect: the background is dimmed down, and
the boundary between foreground and background is blurred:

<img src="/assets/images/spotlighter/screenshot_1@2x.png" width="375pt" height="667pt">
<img src="/assets/images/spotlighter/screenshot_2@2x.png" width="375pt" height="667pt">

Photos edited from within the app can be shared through a standard activity view to the
user's various social media accounts, or sent by e-mail, AirDrop, etc.

Spotlighter also comes bundled with a Photo Editing Extension, so you can also apply 
the filter from within the default Photos app.
