### Short Version

Spotlighter does not store any personal information.

### Long Version

Spotlighter is a client-side only application: it operates on the user's device only, and 
does not directly communicate with or transmit any data to other computers over the 
network.
Spotlighter does, at the explicit request of the user, interact with data sharing 
capabilities provided by the operating system, to share the user's images images over 
various channels at the user's sole discretion. Even in such scenario, no personal 
information is shared without the user's explicit consent, nor is it stored in any location
under our control.
