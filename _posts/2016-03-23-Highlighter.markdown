![App Icon](/assets/images/Highlighter-512.png){: .center-image }

Like I mentioned [last time][PrevPost-link], it is a lot of trouble to highlight a small region of
a screen capture image, like this:

![Example](/assets/images/highlighter_example@2x.png){: .center-image }


So I decided to make a small app that performs all this image processing (overlay 
a semitransparent dimming layer, and cut a hole in it with blurred edges) with 
just one mouse drag. 

The basic functionality is already working, but I still have some polishing (testing) 
to do. Stay tuned!
